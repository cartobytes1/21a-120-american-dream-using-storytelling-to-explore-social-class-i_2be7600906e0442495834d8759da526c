Assignment 1 
-------------

Choose 2 or 3 individuals (famous or otherwise) with whom Studs Terkel conducted interviews (at least one needs to be spoken).

Also consider Terkel’s style of engagement with the interviewees and any differences detected between hearing and reading oral histories.

This assignment is due during Session 3.

Oral History Assignment 
------------------------

For this assignment, you will conduct a taped oral history / interview with another individual and submit a 2–3 page, double-spaced written account of that interview and a partial transcript.

This assignment is due during Session 6.

Museum Exhibit Design Project 
------------------------------

The goal of this exercise is to gain experience working with primary materials in a variety of media formats and to begin thinking about how one would design and put such material together in order to suggest both a “story” for possible viewers and an analysis or interpretation of the material. We’ll be working with materials from the all-volunteer Southeast Chicago Historical Museum.

Write a 2–3 page book review of one of the books from the final section of class (_Old Money_; _Hunger of Memory_; or _Returning to Reims_). Explore what the book can teach us about social class in the United States. You may also choose a book that highlights class  
issues from a region outside the U.S.
